TODO:

This is only an introductory example about houw to use
MAC Constructions (Message Authentciation Codes) in JAVA/JCE

MACs can be used as:
HMACs - Hash-Based Macs
CMACs - Cryptographic Macs

HMACS are also known as "Keyed-Hash Methods" because the idea
here is to use a MAC Key (k) that will be combined with the imput
to produce the MAC... So MAC Keys will be used as "secret" parameters
to produze the MAC... So it can be verified by someone that laso
nows the secret
If you want tp compute MAC you will do something like:

MAC(input) = Hash (input || key)

or, more generically ....

MAC(imput) = Hash [ T(input, key)]
Here T will be a first transforation function parameterized by the
secret key k.
