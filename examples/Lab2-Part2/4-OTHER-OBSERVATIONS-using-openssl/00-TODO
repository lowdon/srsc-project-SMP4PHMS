TODO (try):

you can use openssl (opwnssl tool - shell, command line) to
make cruptographic operatins:

Examples:

1) How to hash an input messahe with SHA-512 ?
(The same for any other hash function implemenetd in openssl)

  $echo "message to be hashed ..." | openssl sha512

2) How to hash a file ?
(the same for any other hash fucntion implemenetd in openssl)
  $openssl dgst -sha512 <inputfile> 
    or simply
  $openssl sha512 <inputfile>     
  
3) How to encrypt/decrypt a file with a certain symmetric algorithm 
   and defined mode, using openssl ?
   
  $openssl aes-256-cbc -a -salt -in secrets.txt -out secrets.txt.enc 
     or ...
  $openssl aes-256-cbc -a -pbkdf2 -salt -in secrets.txt -out secrets.txt.enc 
  
   It will ask you for a "password" and will use the password as a
   seed for the generation of the encryption key ...
   
  $openssl aes-256-cbc -d -a -in secrets.txt.enc -out secrets.txt.new
  
  or
  
  $openssl aes-256-cbc -d -a -pbkdf2 -in secrets.txt.enc -out secrets.txt.new
  

4) How to compare the performance in my computer of different
   cryptographic algorithms/tools using openssl ?
   
   Try:
   
   $openssl speed     // you will have a nice quick benchmark ...
   
   or
   
   $openssl speed aes  // for a certain algorithm ... In this case AES
   
5) What can you say from your comparative performance observations
   comparing hash functions with symmetric encryption ... ?
   
   And about comparisions of different symmetric algorithms ... ?
   
   And about comparision of difefrent symmetric algorithms ... ?
   (example: AES versus BLOWFISH versus TripleDES versus DES)
   
   And about comparisons between certain hash functions with
   certain symmetric algorithms ... 
   (example: AES versus SHA-512 )
