For the examples (java code):
Compile, run, and understand when running.

For this purpose pay attention to the discussion and hands-on
explanations in class.

=====================================================================
To follow and to understand in the Hands-On Lab:

1)
What is the purpose of ListAlgorithms.java ?
- How many crypto algorithms you can use in your
  Java installaton ?
  obs) As you see, you have different algorithms:
       - Symmetric Crypto ALgorithms
       - Asymmetric Crypto Algorithms
       - Algorithms and constructions for Digital Signatures
       - Secure Hash Functions
       - Algorithms and constructions for MACs 
         (Message Authentication Codes) namely:
	 * HMACs - Hash-Based MACs
	 * CMACs - Cryptographic MACs

        Try to identify the names of algorithms for each category
	Remember the purpose of different algorithms.
	A good exercise: try to map the categories and purpposes in the
	referential of security properties, attaks and security mechanisms
	using X.800 Framework concepts (Lectures/Theoretical Classes)

2)
What is the purpose of ListProviders.java ?
Try and see to answer the following questions:
- How many Java Cryptographic Providers do you have in your Java
  Installation and Version ? 
- What is a Java Cryptographic Provider 
  in the JCA (Java Cryptographic Architecture) 
  and JCE Support (Java Cryprographic Extensions)
- How to install/use statically a JCE Cryprographic Provider
  (only suggested for Java versions < 11)
  (Ex., BouncyCastle Crypto Provider)

3)
What is the purpose of SimplePolicyTest ?
What can you observe from running the code ?

- Have you (policy) restrictions or not in using keysizes
  when you use symmetric cryptography in your Java environment ?
- How to manage such restrictions in your Java environment ?  
  Try: if you find restrictions try to overcome such policy
       restrictions.

4)

What is the purpose of SimpleProviderTest or TestePrecedencia classe?
Compile and run the code and try to understand the results:

- Can you modify the precedence order when using crypto algorithms
  and their parameterizations when they are provided in different
  installed crypto-providers ?
- What to do if you want to use specifically use an algorithm from
  a specific crypto-provider ?

=====================================================================
Identify your java installation: JDK, JRE, openjdk, versions, ...
